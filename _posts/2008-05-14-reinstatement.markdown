I've been absent from blogging for a while now. I know, you're all majorly disappointed. Anyway, I just wanted this to say that I'm back and powered by my own little Rails app running on [Passenger at Dreamhost](http://blog.dreamhost.com/2008/05/13/passenger-for-ruby-on-rails/)

Blarg (this app) is really basic, uses [HAML](http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/), [acts_as_taggable_on_steroids](http://github.com/matta/acts_as_taggable_on_steroids/tree/master), & just some HTTP Authâ€¦ nothing fancy. Blarg is up on Github, but is private right now since it is very tailored for this site. I'll try to abstract it out a bit and then leave it open for the world to use.

Anyway, I'm hoping to get back to blogging. I'm going to try to make this a bit more professional than my last incarnation, but it will likely slip a bit into my personal life.
