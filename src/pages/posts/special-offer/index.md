You've all seen these. They're all over purchase confirmation pages on sites like TicketMaster, CampusFood, Fandango. This particular one was on TicketWeb ([after buying tickets to see Matt Pond PA](http://www.theindependentsf.com/calendar/event-detail/?tfly_event_id=7979)).

There's a lot not to understand here... I don't understand why these special offers are always presented as images. Nor do I understand why they would use a button from 1995. Nor do I understand why the button text is anti-aliased but the text text isn't.
