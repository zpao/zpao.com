My homegrown blogging engine worked for a while, but I just don't have the time to make the changes I want. Not only that, but when I blog here, I feel like I need to put a lot of thought into each article. That's not something I have the time to do for everything I want to share.

Several months ago, I decided to give [Tumblr][] another shot. So far it's been working out. It gives me a little bit more flexibility. I can write a thoughtful article, or I can share a funny video I found on YouTube. I feel a lot less pressure to make every post super meaningful.

Eventually I'll put on a fresh coat of paint here and make this more of a launching point to my separate content. I'll still keep the articles around accessible by their current URLs regardless of what I do.

If you're an RSS kind of person & you subscribed to the Feedburner feed, you'll automagically get switched over to the new feed soon.
