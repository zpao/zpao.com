4 years ago (holy shit!) I [launched]({% post_url 2009-01-21-yell-at-the-tv %}) a little project called [Yell at the TV!](http://yellatthetv.com). Up until recently, I'd mostly forgotten about it, but then I got several emails asking for me to remove some tweets. I'd assumed the site just stopped working at some point but apparently not.

For the past 4 years, it's been slowly slurping up tweets with a few searches (most of which probably failed). It was running on Dreamhost shared hosting, on an ancient version of Rails, using SQLite. It had a *1.7GB* production.sqlite. For any number of reasons the site should have stopped working a while ago, but it kept chugging. It was *sloooooooooooooooow* but Google stuck it out and kept scraping.

At the end of the day, I collected 7,240,187 tweets from 3,224,219 users. I only built in 21 shows and ended up with data about 2,441 episodes of those shows. The data collection and episode classification was pretty dumb, so I know not all of these tweets were really about the TV show or episode I assumed they were.

Given the pervasion of Twitter and #hashtags on TV, I still think that there's an experience to explore around this. I would love to see more metadata attached to tweets so somebody could build an experience much like [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com) for video streaming. There's only so much you can get humans to encode machine-parsable data and still convey something valuable for humans in 140 characters. You can see Twitter trying to do this with [#Music](https://music.twitter.com/), so we'll see if they decide to do something for video too.

Anyway, all data has been removed from the site. I may resurrect it in some way if I ever find the time, though honestly just searching Twitter is probably good enough.
