In the spirit of sharing Mercurial extensions this week, did you know that there's a [pager extension](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/PagerExtension) that ships with Mercurial? After using Git for a while and having a nice pager when looking at diffs, I got really annoyed by the fact that I constantly had to scroll my terminal for `hg diff`. I found the Pager extension and there was much rejoicing.

So turn it on and be happy. It'll only page when you need to. And while you're in your `.hgrc`, enable the also-shipped-but-not-on-by-default [Color extension](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/ColorExtension).
