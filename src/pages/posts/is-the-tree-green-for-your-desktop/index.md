[GeekTool](http://projects.tynsoe.org/geektool/) is awesome. [Is the Tree Green?](http://isthetreegreen.com) is awesome. So together they are SUPER AWESOME!

## Python?

Historically, I’m a Ruby guy, but I started learning Python for a Django project I’m (barely) working on. So I picked up a book here at work & decided to flex my pythons a little bit. You can laugh, it’s punny.

The first pass of this took me ~20 minutes, and I just tidied it up this morning so it would take command line options.

## How?

If you’re reading this and actually need to know whether or not the tree is green, then you should be able to figure it out. GeekTool is OS X only, but there are similar programs for Windows and Linux.

It’s easy enough to do what I did in the image above. The program can take 2 arguments `treename` and `output`. Run it with `-h` for usage.

A big thanks to Justin Dolske for [Is the Tree Green?](http://isthetreegreen.com). He deserves more credit for this than I.
