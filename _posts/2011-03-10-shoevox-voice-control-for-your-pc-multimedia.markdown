[Rob](http://rsbaskin.com) and [Max](http://www.maxcutler.com/) are both really smart guys who work really well together (once upon a time, the 3 of us [were working on a startup](http://blog.zpao.com/post/505069286/the-rise-fall-of-courant-news)), so I'm excited to see that they've made something cool. I don't fit the target audience with my OS X loving ways, but I hope others can make use of it.
