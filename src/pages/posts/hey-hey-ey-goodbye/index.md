Today I took my last final exam as a Carnegie Mellon student. It’s been four and a half years, but it feels like just yesterday I got here. Pending that one last grade, today I became a [Master of Information Systems Management](http://ism.cmu.edu/). That degree joins my Bachelor’s degree I finished up in May. I could go on and on about the value of my education or spend time evaluating the programs I was in, but I won’t. I have a lot to say, so I’ll save it for another time. I mean this to be brief.

It’s often said that college changes you. **It’s true.** I really grew up here; or maybe matured. Either way, Carnegie Mellon has had a huge impact on my life. I figured out what I want to do with my life; I made good friends; I fell in love; *I learned*.

Now it’s time to move on, into the scary unknown of the real world. Working the ol’ daily grind, paying the bills, and so on. I’ll be far from my family and friends. I look forward to it though — it’s the next big adventure.

*(Cue sappy music: “A Whole New World”)*

Oh yea, did I mention that I’ll be working on [the best damn browser](http://getfirefox.com) out there?
