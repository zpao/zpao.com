## The Man

Bullet points are easier to write than a proper paragraph, so I'm going to be lazy.

* I'm married to a [pretty cool lady](http://twitter.com/otlvintage) (who thinks being called a lady makes her sound old).
* I've been getting paid to work on [Firefox at Mozilla](http://firefox.com) since 2009.
* I haven't been getting paid to work at [my wife's company](http://onetruelovevintage.com) since 2011.
* I have a [puppy](http://instagr.am/p/lPn7w/)!
* I graduated from [Carnegie Mellon University](http://cmu.edu) twice in 2008.
  First with a BS in Information Systems and then later with a MS in Information Systems Management.
* I'm social on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zpao) & [Facebook](https://facebook.com/pauloshannessy).
* I put code on [Github](https://github.com/zpao).
* I listen to music [Rdio](http://www.rdio.com/people/zpao/) & track that with [last.fm](http://last.fm/user/zpao).
* When I remember, I put photos on [Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/zpao).
* I have a [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/pauloshannessy) account but really don't like it.

## The Site

I was using a homegrown "CMS", and then I started using Tumblr, but now I'm blogging like a hacker and using Jekyll.

I am not a designer, but sometimes I like to pretend I am. I'm using Typekit here to embed 3 typefaces:

* [Futura PT](https://typekit.com/fonts/futura-pt)
* [FF Tisa Web Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/ff-tisa-web-pro)
* [Anonymous Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/anonymous-pro)



## **tl;dr** I do stuff on the internet.
