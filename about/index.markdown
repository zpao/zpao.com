## About zpao.com

This site has gone through many iterations. It was on the web with a couple "free to host" providers and free domains (`.tk` anyone?). Then in 2004 [Matt Claypotch](http://potch.me/) & I decided to go dutch on hosting with [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?98611 "Yea,  that's a referral link for cash money") and this (along with many other sites) have been there since. For a long time I had a Wordpress site here, then I was using Tumblr, then I wrote my own blogging software, then I was using Tumblr again, then I started using Jekyll. I'm sticking with that for the foreseeable future. There's been a blog here for a long time. I've kept a lot of those posts around but let's be honest, they weren't all in the greatest taste.

I've always done my best to bring a bit of design here. I'm by no stretch of the word a "designer" but I have my opinions. Mostly my opinion is "grey and red are cool; use those". Also, I'm unnaturally drawn to typography so I play with that a lot. If I could use Trade Gothic & Futura for everything, I would die a happy man. Currently, I'm making use of [Futura PT](https://typekit.com/fonts/futura-pt), [FF Tisa Web Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/ff-tisa-web-pro), and [Anonymous Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/anonymous-pro).

If you want the quickest & shortest response, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zpao) is probably the best way. Otherwise, I do my best to respond to [email](mailto:paul@oshannessy.com) as quickly as possible.
