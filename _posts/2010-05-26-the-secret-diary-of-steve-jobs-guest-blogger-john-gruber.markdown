**Update:** Oh right, FSJ is entirely satire. I feel dumb, but I'll leave the original post intact. I still stand by the first paragraph.

I used to like [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) a lot. I feel like he's gotten pretty arrogant and a tad ignorant over the past few years. He's written some great articles and had many insightful comments. He's also written some FUD. Nowadays I kind of think he's an ass. Keep in mind, I'm a big Mac fan, have multiple Mac products. But I try to keep my viewpoint a bit rounded and not let myself get completely blinded by the light.

With this coming from FSJ, I'm not 100% sure this is actually John Gruber, but regardless, it makes me feel even more strongly that he's an ass.

Here's a choice quote:

>... and OS X Snow Leopard is the top-selling operating system on Amazon for the 125th straight week, so you tell me who’s right and who’s wrong. Yeah. I thought so. You’ve just been destroyed. Crushed. Embarrassed and humiliated, ground to dust under the heel of my boot. Be gone now, you Windows loving FUD machine. You ugly Apple hating troll. You porn-loving Android user, pleasuring yourself with your Nexus One.

1. Even including pre-sales, that means Snow Leopard has been on sale for 2.5 years! I'm calling shenanigans on that.
2. Go ahead and take a look at the ["Best Sellers in Operating Systems" page](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/software/229653/ref=pd_ts_sw_nav). Is it just me or does that say Windows 7?

So Mr. (Fake?) Gruber. *You* are wrong.
