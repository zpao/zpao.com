>Almost without exception, police officials have staunchly supported the arresting officers. This argues strongly against the idea that some rogue officers are overreacting or that a few cops have something to hide. "Arrest those who record the police" appears to be official policy, and it's backed by the courts.

I've take a [few photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/zpao/sets/72157613241445785/) of officers in action without arrest. I'm worried by the direction the law is heading -- that it becomes a crime punishable by multiple years in prison, just for photographing a cop (doing something wrong).
