Nobody has said anything but I haven't had pagination enabled on this blog since it started. It was initially cut from the theme since I didn't like what I'd done and I didn't have to worry about it.

This summer I realized I had more than 1 page of content but didn't care enough.

Tonight I just took out the comments that had been hiding the content. Turns out what I had designed is good enough to get the point across.
