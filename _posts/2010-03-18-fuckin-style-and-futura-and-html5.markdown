I've been wanting to redesign my blog for a while. Back on the [old blog](http://zpao.com), I still have the same theme as I made [a year and a half ago](/posts/new_design_updates), which for me is pretty impressive. I tend to redesign at the drop of a hat, work on it for a while, then forget about it. Eventually I'll spend a day on a completely different design and that's what I use.

When I started [using Tumblr for blogging](/posts/tumbling-down-the-rabbit-hole-again), I wanted to make it look slick. But I didn't have the time, so I went with [the cleanest pre-made theme I could find](http://www.tumblr.com/theme/1909). It worked well, and I was just going to tweak it. But then I decided I wanted to see what the buzz was about HTML5. So I rewrote that theme with the appropriate `<article>`, et al. tags and my own, cleaner CSS. But it didn't feel right. So I started over with minimal markup with no style, and just played with it. I still drew inspiration from that theme, but that's ok.

Anyway, it's a work in progress. I won't post about it again, but you may notice things change or break as I tweak it (or add features, like pagination or conversation posts). If you love [clean, structured CSS](http://static.zpao.com/tumblr/future.css) with variables, check out [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).

Also, if you don't have Futura and you just see Helvetica (or even Arial), I'm sorry. It looks way better for me.
