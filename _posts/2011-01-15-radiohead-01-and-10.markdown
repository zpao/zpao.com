This might be old news to some, but I found it pretty interesting...

> Consider that In Rainbows was meant to complement OK Computer, musically, lyrically, and in structure. We found that the two albums can be knit together beautifully. By combining the tracks to form one playlist, 01 and 10, we have a remarkable listening experience. The transitions between the songs are astounding, and it appears that this was done purposefully.

I set this playlist up and it really is a great listening experience. It might not be intentional but I don't care. If you have both albums give it a listen.
