For a long time I've had Git info in my terminal prompt. At Mozilla, we mostly use Mercurial though, so a Git aware terminal wasn't super helpful. A couple times I tried to hack together something for Mercurial to show me my current branch or applied patch queue. Every time though I either didn't get everything I wanted or was too lazy to make it work like I wanted (and play nicely with my other customizations).

This morning I started on this problem again. But this time I started by searching for a solution first and voil√†, I found hg-prompt. Take a look at [the samples](http://sjl.bitbucket.org/hg-prompt/documentation/samples/) and then customize it with the [extended list of keywords available](http://sjl.bitbucket.org/hg-prompt/documentation/keywords/).
