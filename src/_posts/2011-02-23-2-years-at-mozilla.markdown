On February 23rd, 2009 I started full-time at Mozilla. So much has happened since then, yet it still feels like it was just a couple months ago.

In addition to my time as an intern, I feel like I've seen a lot at Mozilla. With Firefox 4 I'll be seeing my 4th release; 3.0 came out very shortly into my internship, followed by 3.5 soon after I started. 3.6 was my first version where I was around for the whole release, and 4 is so close I can taste it. I've had 4 bosses (Connor, Beltzner, Dietrich, and Dolske). We're now on our 2nd CEO; I've seen 1 VP Engineering leave. I've met awesome people, and attended 2 summits.

I've worked on the password manager, satchel, session restore, the Jetpack prototype, the Add-on SDK, per tab network prioritization, and a whole bunch of random front-end stuff. I ported the Sync extension into Firefox and helped make Firefox work on Windows CE. I've even written docshell & widget code (even if it didn't all get checked in)! The fact that I've gotten to work on such varying parts of Firefox is one of my favorite things about my job.

A lot has happened in my personal life as well. I lived by myself for the first time while Amanda was back at school (actually by myself, not counting dorm life or sharing a house). I've cleaned up more cat puke than I ever thought I would. I've made new friends and grown apart from older friends. _I got engaged!_ I helped my fianc√©e start a company.

I guess it's actually been a pretty long 2 years.
