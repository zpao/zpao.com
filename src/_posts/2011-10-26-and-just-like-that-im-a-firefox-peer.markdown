Not-so-long story short, as of a couple weeks ago Firefox review policies changed and now I can review any code going into Firefox (`browser/`)! In actuality though, if a review request came my way in an area I wasn't familiar with, I would just give feedback and redirect the review to somebody more familiar with that code.

Read up on the [new Firefox review policy](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Code_Review) and see [who else can review your patches](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Firefox) to Firefox.
