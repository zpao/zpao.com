Roughly 6% of the people visiting this site in the past month were using IE6. That’s mostly insignificant, but I despise IE6 and had to do my part to put an end to it. So, following in the footsteps of [The Rissington Podcast](http://therissingtonpodcast.co.uk/) (and surely others), I’m serving up an IE6 stylesheet complete with Comic Sans. I also put together a super tiny script that puts a special message up top.

I’d been wanting to do this for a while, but it’s finally done. I’m using conditional comments to differentiate browsers. I used JavaScript to display the message so I wouldn’t be adding clutter to my source, even if nobody else would see it. View the source if you’re interested.

And yes, I’m biased about the browser I’m suggesting, but I’m allowed to be.
