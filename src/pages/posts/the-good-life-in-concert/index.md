Last Thursday I saw [The Good Life](http://www.thegoodlifemusic.com) play at [Bottom of the Hill](http://www.bottomofthehill.com) with Victoria and Megan. With the exception of the obnoxiously loud drunk girl dropping pint glasses nearby, it was one of the better shows I've been to in a while. Tim Kasher is just a great performer and he really pours his heart into the music. Bottom of the Hill is a small venue, but for a band like The Good Life, the intimacy is entirely appropriate. They played a lot of fan favorites and even covered Fleetwood Mac's "The Chain," which was pretty cool. They finished strong with "Album of the Year" as seen in the video above.
