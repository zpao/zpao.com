Hey there avid internetter.
You may have noticed that there's nothing on this page.
That's because I decided to stop using Tumblr and host all of my content myself.
I've set up redirects so if you visit an old URL, it should take you to the right place.

I still think Tumblr is a great service for a lot of people, but it just doesn't fit with the way I want to blog anymore. If for some reason you *really* want to view the content on Tumblr, the old site still exists, just not at this domain. Check out [zpao.tumblr.com](http://zpao.tumblr.com).

Are you done reading that? It's time to head over to **[zpao.com](http://zpao.com)** now.
