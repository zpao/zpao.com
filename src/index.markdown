Hi! In case you didn't catch it on the side, I'm Paul O&rsquo;Shannessy. This is where I live on the Internet.

I'm a software developer living in San Francisco. By day I write code for Facebook. By night I fight for the web and move furniture. [Read more about me & this site...](/about)

At this point, I primarily use this site for writing. The last thing I wrote was titled {% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}*[{{ post.title | markdownify2 }}]({{ post.url }})*{% endfor %}.
