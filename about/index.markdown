## About Paul

* I'm originally from the east coast of the US, growing up outside Philadelphia and then living in Pittsburgh for school. The west coast really is the best coast though. San Francisco was home for many years before moving to Seattle.

**tl;dr** I do stuff on the internet.


## About zpao.com

This site has gone through many iterations. It was on the web with a couple "free to host" providers and free domains (`.tk` anyone?). Then in 2004 [Matt Claypotch](http://potch.me/) & I decided to go dutch on hosting with [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?98611 "Yea, that's a referral link for cash money") and this (along with many other sites) have been there since. For a long time I had a Wordpress site here, then I was using Tumblr, then I wrote my own blogging software, then I was using Tumblr again, then I started using Jekyll. I'm sticking with that for the foreseeable future. There's been a blog here for a long time. I've kept a lot of those posts around but let's be honest, they weren't all in the greatest taste.

The current design was probably inspired by [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/). I've been using it a lot over the past few years to do most of my writing and I really enjoy the simplicity of it. As much as I would like, I can't use their custom typeface here, so I'm using [Inconsolata](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Inconsolata) for everything.
