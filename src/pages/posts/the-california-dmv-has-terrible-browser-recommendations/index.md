It appears as though the California DMV has not updated their website in the past 10 years...

>To be able to use this online application, your computer will need to have one of the latest versions of either the Internet Explorer, Netscape Communicator/Navigator, or equivalent web browsers. For Internet Explorer you must have version 4.0 or higher. We suggest you use Netscape Communicator/Navigator version 6.0 or higher to eliminate any possible printer problems.

Internet Explorer 4 came out in 1997. Netscape 6 came out in 2000. How far we've come...

In related news, the next available appointment (to take the "written" test) at the DMV in San Francisco is halfway through March. I bet I could get a new passport sooner.
